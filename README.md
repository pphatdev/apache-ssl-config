# Apache SSL Configuration Guide
This guide shows you how to set up a local domain with SSL/HTTPS using [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/) web server.

# Setup Requirements
## Before you begin, you'll need:
- Your web project files in a directory (either `index.php` or a `public` folder for Laravel projects)
- A custom local domain name of your choice
- SSL certificate (`.crt` file - don't worry, we'll help you generate this)
- Administrator/root access to run the configuration
